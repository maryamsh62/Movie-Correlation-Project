#  Movie Industry Correlation Project


This project explores which movie features (like budget, score, and votes) are correlated with gross revenue using a dataset of movies. The dataset used in this project contains information of 6820 movies collected from The **Movie Industry** Dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies). 

Our first step is to clean and format the movie dataset to prepare it for analysis. Once the data is properly structured, we will explore correlations among all available fields to identify which factors are directly or strongly related to gross revenue. Understanding these relationships is valuable because it reveals what variables most significantly impact a film’s financial success.



##  Tools Used 

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub


##  Key Steps
- Data wrangling : gathering, assessing and cleaning data
- Handling nulls with group-wise and global medians
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (e.g., extracting release year)
- Correlation analysis 
- Visualizations: heatmaps, scatter plots


## Result

Across the dataset, votes and budget are the variables most strongly and consistently associated with gross revenue. In contrast, the production company shows a weak standalone relationship with gross—company identity by itself is not a reliable predictor once other factors are considered. The evidence indicates that audience reach (votes) and investment level (budget) are the primary signals linked to box-office performance.
